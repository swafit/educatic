                  Throughout history the native American people residing in Canada have faced various injustices. They have been subjugated to things such as residential schools and having their land taken away from them. Even now a handful of native American communities face an on going problem regarding contamination of their drinking water. As of now there are currently 29 drinking water advisories.
                  <br>
                  Since 1996, Canada has spent 2.5 billion dollars in indigenous communities building new or improving existing infrastructure and more than 50% has been spent since 2006. Even though the Canadian government is spending such a large amount of money on infrastructure there a still plenty of problems with the water supply systems of these native communities.  You might be asking yourself that even with all this money being put to fight this injustice is it really going to make a difference, the answer would be yes. Since 2015, 85 indigenous communities have had their water advisories taken away. While this is a good thing the remaining 29 reservations must not be forgotten.
                  <br>
                  If you wish to help then there are various things that you could do. One thing is to tell you're friends or family about this crisis. You could also spread the news through social media which has been a great tool for fighting a plethora of other problems. Additionally Educatic Activism has a social media page on both Youtube and  Instagram. There you will be able to find more information about the native American water crisis. Besides spreading information about the crisis there are various organizations whose mission is to aid the native communities. One great example is Water First. They have recently raised seven hundred thousand in order to fight for this cause. Spread the news and support organizations such as Water First and you will be able to make a difference.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">This blogpost focuses on the Oneida people, also called the Onyota'a:ka which means “The people of the standing stone”. They are from the Iroquois confederacy and are followers of the great law of peace which can be thought of as the Iroquois constitution. As of 2019, 18 years' worth of water tests were found to be contaminated, frequently showing dangerously high levels of pathogens like E. Coli. This water comes from the Thames River that flows through the Oneida community as well as many other indigenous communities. These First Nations share this river with the city of London, Ontario, who frequently dumps rainwater and raw sewage into the river, a measly 30 minutes upstream from their indigenous neighbours. This contamination combined with their inadequate water filtration system has caused Oneida's water supply to become a danger to its community. In tests done by independent engineering firms, Oneida's water system scored zeroes for the removal of waterborne parasites as well as viruses. Parasites causing gastrointestinal illnesses such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia are common in Oneida's water. Cryptosporidium especially is dangerous, as it can be deadly to those with weakened immune systems. Experts across the board concur that the presence of such contamination in the water supply proves that the chlorine treatment systems are not performing at anything near an acceptable level. The reports from the engineering firm Neegan Burnside only confirmed this: a calculated 94 minutes of contact between the unprocessed water and the chlorine was needed for this filtration plant to remove all pathogens from the water. As of the reports writing, Oneida's water was clocking in a measly 1.6 minutes of contact.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">WaterFirst is an organization that is devoted to helping spread awareness of indigenous communities' water issues as well as manage multiple campaigns to directly help indigenous communities. Their “Water First Internship Program” is their primary way of helping indigenous communities, especially in the long term. Aboriginal men and women who are accepted into the program are trained to become water treatment plant operators over the course of 15 months. Once they complete the program, they then have the opportunity to manage the water plants of their communities. WaterFirst's program is helping provide suitable drinking water for years to come as well as valuable employment opportunities.
                  Water First's program is dedicated to engaging young aboriginals and promoting them working to aid their communities. The graduates become part of a long-term boon for their communities, helping to sustainably reduce water issues. 
                  Many of Water First's alumni often go on to pursue even more certifications, furthering their education and opening more doors. 
                  Over the course of the 15 month program, the interns receive at least 2000 hours of experience and training in the classroom as well as at local water treatment facilities. The program also offers training for other skills such as resume writing and networking. To make the program more accessible, Water First offers additional aid like childcare services and transportation access.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">Marten Falls First Nation is an Anishinaabe First Nation in Northern Ontario, Canada. The band owns a single reserve, Marten Falls, located in the Kenora District, along the Albany River. As of March 2022, the band has a total registered population of 838 members. The nation is under water advisory since 2005 and hasn't had clean water evere since. They have been using bottled water for everything. Marten Falls is also known for the story of Chanie "Charlie" Wenjack who was an Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) First Nations kid who ran away from Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in Kenora, Ontario, Canada, where he boarded for three years while attending residential school. He died of starvation and exposure while attempting to travel 600 kilometres (370 miles) back to his home, Ogoki Post on the Marten Falls Reserve, in Farlane, Ontario. To help fix this water issue, a compagny by the name of "Colliers Project Leaders", is planning on releasing a project plan that will cost over $9.8M, to help fight injustices this reserve is still undergoing.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">The issue of Native American's access to clean water inevitably leads back to the federal Canadian government. How come Canada, which holds an estimated 9% of the renewable fresh water supply of the world, cannot provide water to it's own citizens? It is frankly appalling, that so many Canadians must go years or even decades without clean water. As of 2012, government data showed that more 50% of the water filtration systems on reserves continued to pose a threat to their communities. This is despite the federal government investing billions of dollars into infrastructure for First Nations communities. This suggests a deeper-rooted issue, one stemming from the unique situation history between Canadian government and the Aboriginal communities. Unlike the rest of Canada, the Reserves fall directly under the jurisdiction of the federal government, instead of the provincial and municipal system we are familiar with. We must not allow these issues to be swept under the rug, we must keep the pressure on the governments to bring about the systemic changes required to help our fellow Canadians.

                  The Mohawks of the bay of quinte are a community of Indigenous people who have had no clean and safe water since around 2008. On June 6 an initial “Boil water advisory” has been set, exactly 1 year later in 2009 was this advisory considered to be a long term advisory.
                  <br>
                  “Built on and united by our language, culture, traditions, knowledge and history.” Is a quote taken directly found on their site linked bellow. Since 2009 the community has been using a water delivery service for people to receive clean water. Their water delivery service top priorities are water safety and ensuring that members get access to safe water. At every location their water is tested to “ensure health and safety”. This is possible via the Indigenous Service Canada which provides funding for the water delivery service. The indigenous service Canada “is one of two departments in the government of Canada with responsibility for policies relating to indigenous people.”
                  <br>
                  Currently there is construction underway for a better system however it is not right that it has taken more than a decade for them to reach this point. Nearby towns such Bellville have had priority over their clean water. Bellville is a town about 7-10 minutes away from the territory, while there have been water issues in the past it simply doesn’t make sense that they are able to get clean water faster than the people of Tyendinaga community.
