            <p class="text-center">Educatic.site is a website that raises awareness to the lack of clean water in the Native
              American territories around Canada. We are a group of activists that are attempting to give as much
              attention to this problem as possible. We believe in the fact of having equal rights and equal access to
               basic necessities, no matter what gender, religion or financial background someone comes from.</p>

              Throughout history the native American people residing in Canada have faced various injustices. They have been subjugated to things such as residential schools and having their land taken away from them. Even now a handful of native American communities face an on going problem regarding contamination of their drinking water. As of now there are currently 29 drinking water advisories.
              <br>
              Since 1996, Canada has spent 2.5 billion dollars in indigenous communities building new or improving existing infrastructure and more than 50% has been spent since 2006. Even though the Canadian government is spending such a large amount of money on infrastructure there a still plenty of problems with the water supply systems of these native communities.  You might be asking yourself that even with all this money being put to fight this injustice is it really going to make a difference, the answer would be yes. Since 2015, 85 indigenous communities have had their water advisories taken away. While this is a good thing the remaining 29 reservations must not be forgotten.
              <br>
              If you wish to help then there are various things that you could do. One thing is to tell youâ€™re friends or family about this crisis. You could also spread the news through social media which has been a great tool for fighting a plethora of other problems. Additionally Educatic Activism has a social media page on both Youtube and  Instagram. There you will be able to find more information about the native American water crisis. Besides spreading information about the crisis there are various organizations whose mission is to aid the native communities. One great example is Water First. They have recently raised seven hundred thousand in order to fight for this cause. Spread the news and support organizations such as Water First and you will be able to make a difference.
