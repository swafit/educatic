              Throughout history the native American people residing in Canada have faced various injustices. They have been subjugated to things such as residential schools and having their land taken away from them. Even now a handful of native American communities face an on going problem regarding contamination of their drinking water. As of now there are currently 29 drinking water advisories.
              <br>
              Since 1996, Canada has spent 2.5 billion dollars in indigenous communities building new or improving existing infrastructure and more than 50% has been spent since 2006. Even though the Canadian government is spending such a large amount of money on infrastructure there a still plenty of problems with the water supply systems of these native communities.  You might be asking yourself that even with all this money being put to fight this injustice is it really going to make a difference, the answer would be yes. Since 2015, 85 indigenous communities have had their water advisories taken away. While this is a good thing the remaining 29 reservations must not be forgotten.
              <br>
              If you wish to help then there are various things that you could do. One thing is to tell you're friends or family about this crisis. You could also spread the news through social media which has been a great tool for fighting a plethora of other problems. Additionally Educatic Activism has a social media page on both Youtube and  Instagram. There you will be able to find more information about the native American water crisis. Besides spreading information about the crisis there are various organizations whose mission is to aid the native communities. One great example is Water First. They have recently raised seven hundred thousand in order to fight for this cause. Spread the news and support organizations such as Water First and you will be able to make a difference.

          <p>This blogpost focuses on the Oneida people, also called the Onyota'a:ka which means “The people of the standing stone”. They are from the Iroquois confederacy and are followers of the great law of peace which can be thought of as the Iroquois constitution. As of 2019, 18 years' worth of water tests were found to be contaminated, frequently showing dangerously high levels of pathogens like E. Coli. This water comes from the Thames River that flows through the Oneida community as well as many other indigenous communities. These First Nations share this river with the city of London, Ontario, who frequently dumps rainwater and raw sewage into the river, a measly 30 minutes upstream from their indigenous neighbours. This contamination combined with their inadequate water filtration system has caused Oneida's water supply to become a danger to its community. In tests done by independent engineering firms, Oneida's water system scored zeroes for the removal of waterborne parasites as well as viruses. Parasites causing gastrointestinal illnesses such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia are common in Oneida's water. Cryptosporidium especially is dangerous, as it can be deadly to those with weakened immune systems. Experts across the board concur that the presence of such contamination in the water supply proves that the chlorine treatment systems are not performing at anything near an acceptable level. The reports from the engineering firm Neegan Burnside only confirmed this: a calculated 94 minutes of contact between the unprocessed water and the chlorine was needed for this filtration plant to remove all pathogens from the water. As of the reports writing, Oneida's water was clocking in a measly 1.6 minutes of contact. </p>
