# educatic
Educatic is a website that raises awareness of the lack of clean water in the Native American territories around Canada. We are a group of activists who are attempting to give as much attention to this problem as possible. We believe in the fact of having equal rights and equal access to necessities, no matter what gender, religion or financial background someone comes from.
